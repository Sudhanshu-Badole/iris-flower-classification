# Iris Flower Classification Machine Learning Model
Iris flower classification is a popular machine learning problem, where the goal is to classify the species of the Iris flower based on certain characteristics such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. This repository contains the Python code to solve this problem.

## Problem Definition
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. The task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

## Files in Repository
* iris_flower_classification.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for this project.
* Iris.csv: Dataset used in the project.
* README.md: Documentation file.

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries are used in this project:
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib.pyplot
* seaborn

## Data Collection and Preparation
The Iris dataset was imported using pandas library. It contains 150 samples and 6 columns, which includes an Id column, 4 measurement columns, and the species column. The dataset was inspected for missing values and statistics. The species column was checked for the distribution of classes. The dataset consists of 150 samples, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. There are three classes, each representing a different species of the Iris flower: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Machine Learning Model
In this project, I am utilizing a combination of advanced machine learning algorithms to build a powerful predictive model. Specifically, I am employing logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines (SVMs) to analyze and extract insights from the data. These models are well-suited for handling complex data patterns and generating accurate predictions, making them ideal for this project's objectives. By utilizing these sophisticated techniques, I am confident that I will be able to deliver highly accurate and reliable results that will help inform and drive important business decisions.

## Results
The project results in a machine learning model that can classify the species of the Iris flower with high accuracy. The best performing model is a support vector machine with an accuracy of 97.8% on the testing set. The model is also able to generalize well to new data, achieving an accuracy of 95.6% on the holdout dataset.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms for classification problems and provides a good introduction to data preprocessing, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The results show that even a simple machine learning model can achieve high accuracy on a well-known dataset like the Iris dataset.
